Node Proxy Server
===
This is a simple Dropbox clone built in Node.js. The idea was to create the basic RESTful HTTP methods, and then build upon them by introducing a CLI and TCP functionality to automatically synchronize multiple locations.

ES6 features have been used - make sure to run using [Babel](https://babeljs.io).
